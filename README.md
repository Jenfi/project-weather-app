# Build a Weather Web App :sunny:

The project is a simple web app showing today's weather but also a five day-forecast in a selected location by using an open weather-API. 

## Tools and techniques used 💪🏼

Html, CSS, Javascript, fetch and promises, Date() object. Styling made in flexbox. 

## My process 🧠

This was my first project working with API. I started out by deciding what city I wanted to show for this project and after that getting the API key and API link for the fetch I wanted to do. Once I had fetched the API I studied it, the structure and what data I needed. I split up the project in smaller parts an dmade a plan for how to finalise it. My first main focus was finalising the current weather, showing all data and styling it before going forward to the forecast. 
If I would have hade more time for the project I would have styled the forecast-part nier, maybe presenting the dates and weathers in another nicer way. Maybe adding weather icons.
